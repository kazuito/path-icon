# material-icon-resolver

Resolve VS Code Material Icon Theme icon names, SVG filenames, and CDN URLs from file or folder paths. TypeScript library with ESM and CommonJS builds, distributed via npm.

## Repo Map

- `src/index.ts` — public API re-exports
- `src/resolve.ts` — `resolveMaterialIcon`, `getMaterialIconName`, `getMaterialIconCdnUrl`
- `src/file.ts` — file-only resolver for `material-icon-resolver/file`; imports only file icon generated data
- `src/folder.ts` — folder-only resolver for `material-icon-resolver/folder`; imports only folder icon generated data
- `src/result.ts` — shared result / CDN URL construction
- `src/normalize.ts` — path normalization, basename/parent split, extension candidates
- `src/packed.ts` — `unpack` decoder for the brace-trie packed tables in `src/generated/*.ts`; also used by the generator's round-trip assertion
- `src/cdn.ts` — jsDelivr / unpkg / `baseUrl` URL builders
- `src/types.ts` — public type definitions
- `src/generated/*.ts` — **auto-generated; do not edit by hand**. Re-run `pnpm generate`.
- `scripts/generate.ts` — reads upstream `vscode-material-icon-theme` from the `vendor/` git submodule and rebuilds `src/generated/*.ts`
- `scripts/sync-vscode-languages.ts` — regenerates `scripts/generated/vscode-language-map.json` (language id → extensions/fileNames) from the `contributes.languages` of VS Code built-in extensions at a pinned tag
- `scripts/language-id-extensions.ts` — residual language-id associations from third-party extensions; each entry cites its origin
- `vendor/vscode-material-icon-theme/` — git submodule pinned to a specific upstream release tag; the source of truth for which version is generated
- `scripts/validate-icons.ts` — fetches the published npm tarball and asserts every referenced SVG name actually exists
- `test/` — vitest suites (file resolver, folder resolver, CDN URL)
- `dist/` — tsdown output (`.mjs` / `.cjs` + `.d.mts` / `.d.cts`); gitignored
- `PLAN.md` — original Japanese design doc, kept for context

## Commands

```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive  # required before first generate
pnpm install
pnpm typecheck       # tsc --noEmit
pnpm test            # vitest run
pnpm build           # tsdown → ESM/CJS outputs for root, file, and folder entries
pnpm generate        # regenerate src/generated/*.ts from the pinned submodule
pnpm sync-vscode-languages  # refresh scripts/generated/vscode-language-map.json from the pinned VS Code tag, then regenerate
pnpm validate-icons  # fetch npm tarball, check every referenced SVG exists
pnpm lint            # biome lint
pnpm format          # biome format --write
```

## Workflow Expectations

- After editing source, run `pnpm typecheck && pnpm test && pnpm build` before declaring done.
- When to run which regeneration command:

  | You changed | Run |
  |---|---|
  | `vendor/` submodule (icon theme bump) | `pnpm generate` → `pnpm validate-icons` → `pnpm test` |
  | `VSCODE_TAG` in `scripts/sync-vscode-languages.ts` | `pnpm sync-vscode-languages` (regenerates automatically) → `pnpm test` |
  | `scripts/language-id-extensions.ts` (residual map) | `pnpm generate` → `pnpm test` |

  Rule of thumb: changed any generator input → `pnpm generate`; want newer VS Code language data → `pnpm sync-vscode-languages`, which chains `pnpm generate` for you.
- After bumping the upstream version: `pnpm generate` → `pnpm validate-icons` → `pnpm test` → update `metadata.upstreamVersion` consumers.
- Never hand-edit `src/generated/*.ts`; treat them like build artifacts that happen to be checked in.
- Internal relative imports must include the `.ts` extension (`./resolve.ts`, not `./resolve`). `tsconfig.json` enables `allowImportingTsExtensions` + `rewriteRelativeImportExtensions`; tsdown rewrites them at build time.

## Generator Setup

- Upstream `material-extensions/vscode-material-icon-theme` lives as a git submodule at `vendor/vscode-material-icon-theme`, pinned to a specific release tag.
- First time setup: `git submodule update --init --recursive`. Fresh clones should use `git clone --recurse-submodules ...`.
- The generator imports `src/core/icons/{fileIcons,folderIcons,languageIcons}.ts` directly from the submodule's checked-out tree and records the submodule HEAD commit in `metadata.upstreamCommit`. No worktree is created.
- To bump the upstream version: `cd vendor/vscode-material-icon-theme && git fetch --tags && git checkout v<new-version> && cd -`, then `git add vendor/vscode-material-icon-theme` and run `pnpm generate`. **Always pin to a release tag** — the submodule's `main` HEAD often contains unreleased icons whose SVGs aren't yet on the CDN.
- `MATERIAL_ICON_THEME_REPO=/path/to/clone` is supported as an escape hatch (e.g. for testing against a local upstream working copy); when set, the script reads that path's HEAD instead of the submodule. Caller is responsible for checking out a sensible ref.

## Codebase Rules

- File resolver order: `fileNamesWithPath[parent/basename]` → `fileNames[basename]` → `fileExtensions[longest…shortest]` → fallback. All keys lowercase.
- Folder resolver order: `rootFolderNames[basename]` → `folderNames[basename]` → fallback. Keys are pre-expanded with the upstream `extendFolderNames` rule (`name`, `.name`, `_name`, `-name`, `__name__`).
- The `-open` suffix for expanded folders is appended only at filename construction in `src/result.ts#makeResult`; map values store the bare icon name.
- Keep file-only and folder-only entry points independent: `src/file.ts` must not import `src/generated/folder-icons.ts`, and `src/folder.ts` must not import `src/generated/file-icons.ts`.
- Generated tables are packed as `name|keys` groups joined by `;`, where `keys` is a brace-expansion trie (`webpack.{base.{cjs,js},cjs}`), an empty key means the key equals `name`, and folder icons drop the `folder-` prefix. Keys or icons containing `; | , { }`, and folder icons without the `folder-` prefix, fail `pnpm generate`. Lookup tables are `Object.create(null)`, so keys like `constructor` / `__proto__` behave as ordinary keys.
- Icons with `clone: { ... }` in upstream are **skipped** by the generator — upstream generates those SVGs at runtime and they aren't published in the npm package. Don't try to add them back.
- Default `activeIconPack` is `"angular"` (matches upstream `defaultConfig`). Icons gated by other packs (vue, react, qwik, …) are excluded.
- VS Code language IDs ARE used. Upstream `languageIcons.ts` is read at generate time and each language id is expanded to file extensions / fileNames through layered sources, first write wins: (1) explicit `fileIcons.ts#fileExtensions` / `fileNames` entries, (2) `scripts/generated/vscode-language-map.json` — synced from the `contributes.languages` of VS Code's built-in extensions at the tag pinned in `scripts/sync-vscode-languages.ts` (`pnpm sync-vscode-languages` to refresh; bump `VSCODE_TAG` there for a newer VS Code), (3) the residual hand map `scripts/language-id-extensions.ts` for ids defined by third-party marketplace extensions — every entry must cite its origin (`via … — <url>` or `curated: …`), (4) for ids with no source whose icon would otherwise be unreachable, the id itself is used as a file extension (fallback). `pnpm generate` warns when a residual entry goes stale or fully shadowed (delete it) and when a new upstream id lands in the fallback (add a sourced entry or re-sync).
- Custom icon associations, light/highContrast variants, and clone icons remain out of scope (see `PLAN.md` §4).

## Safety / Gotchas

- `package.json#exports` uses per-condition types (`import.types` → `.d.mts`, `require.types` → `.d.cts`) for proper dual-package type resolution. `typesVersions` is set so legacy `--moduleResolution node` consumers can resolve `./file` and `./folder` subpaths. If you change build entry names, output extensions, or declaration filenames, update `exports` and `typesVersions` to match. Validate with `pnpm dlx @arethetypeswrong/cli --pack .` (all entries should be 🟢 across node10/node16/bundler).
- `tsdown.config.ts` has `minify: true` for size; debugging the bundle requires reading source instead.
- Default `version` in `ResolveMaterialIconOptions` is pinned to `metadata.upstreamVersion`, not `latest`. Users opt into `latest` explicitly. Don't change this default — the generated association table only matches the pinned version's SVG inventory.
- The validator fetches the tarball from `registry.npmjs.org` directly (it does not call `npm pack`, which previously hit local cache permission issues).
